# Postmortem: Database Outage on June 21, 2024

## Issue Summary

**Duration:**  
Start: June 21, 2024, 09:00 AM UTC  
End: June 21, 2024, 12:30 PM UTC

**Impact:**  
Our primary database service was down, leading to a complete outage of our main web application. Users experienced 500 Internal Server Error messages and were unable to access the platform. Approximately 85% of our users were affected during this period.

**Root Cause:**  
A misconfiguration in the database cluster's load balancer caused all incoming traffic to be directed to a single database node, which became overwhelmed and crashed.

## Timeline

- **09:00 AM:** Issue detected by monitoring alert indicating a sharp rise in error rates and response times.
- **09:05 AM:** On-call engineer received alert and began initial investigation.
- **09:10 AM:** Identified the database as the primary source of the issue due to increased connection timeouts.
- **09:20 AM:** Restarted the database service on the affected node, but the issue persisted.
- **09:40 AM:** Misleading path: suspected a network issue and involved the network operations team.
- **10:10 AM:** Escalated to the database team after ruling out network problems.
- **10:30 AM:** Database team identified the load balancer misconfiguration.
- **10:45 AM:** Reconfigured the load balancer to distribute traffic evenly across all database nodes.
- **11:00 AM:** Incremental recovery observed as load distribution normalized.
- **12:00 PM:** Full service restored and verified by QA team.
- **12:30 PM:** Outage officially declared resolved.

## Root Cause and Resolution

### Root Cause:

The load balancer for our database cluster was misconfigured during a recent update. Instead of distributing incoming traffic across multiple nodes, it funneled all traffic to a single node. This node became overwhelmed, leading to its crash and the subsequent outage of our web application.

### Resolution:

Once the root cause was identified, the following steps were taken to resolve the issue:

1. **Reconfigured the Load Balancer:** Updated the load balancer settings to ensure even traffic distribution across all database nodes.
2. **Restarted the Database Node:** Brought the overwhelmed node back online.
3. **Incremental Traffic Recovery:** Gradually redirected traffic to ensure stability before allowing full user access.
4. **QA Verification:** Conducted extensive testing to ensure the system was fully operational and stable.

## Corrective and Preventative Measures

### Improvements:

1. **Configuration Management:** Implement a more rigorous review process for configuration changes.
2. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Add detailed monitoring and alerting for load balancer configurations and database node health.
3. **Incident Response Training:** Conduct regular drills to improve incident response time and efficiency.

### TODO List:

1. **Patch Load Balancer Software:** Apply latest patches and updates to prevent similar misconfigurations.
2. **Add Load Balancer Monitoring:** Integrate specific load balancer metrics into our monitoring system to detect imbalances early.
3. **Update Documentation:** Revise and update the documentation for configuration changes and incident response protocols.
4. **Conduct a Post-Incident Review Meeting:** Schedule a meeting with all involved teams to

review the incident, discuss lessons learned, and finalize action items.

By addressing these corrective and preventative measures, we aim to prevent similar incidents in the future and improve our overall system reliability and response efficiency.
